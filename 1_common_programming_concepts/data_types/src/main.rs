                    ----------------------------
                    The isize type in Rust is used to represent a signed integer that has the same size as a pointer on the current platform.
                    It is architecture-dependent and will have a size of 32 bits on 32-bit platforms and 64 bits on 64-bit platforms.

                    https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-overflow

                    Integer overflow aren't checked in --release mode. What would happen if we add 1 to the maximum value of i8?
                    It would wrap around to the minimum value of i8. This is called two's complement wrapping.

                Rust Memory Safety in this case
                -------------------------------

                In rust, accessing elements beyond bound is a runtime error.
                You would get a runtime error like this: thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10'
                Other languages like C/C++ do not perform bounds checking by default.
                As a result, accessing elements outside the bounds of an array in C or C++ can lead to undefined behavior,
                such as reading or writing to unintended memory locations, causing crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

                In other languages, invalid memory access might be provided for cases as above.
                Rust protects you against this kind of error by immediately exiting.
                The program will be safely aborted, which is much better than continuing with undefined behavior.
