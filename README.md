## Learning Rust

In this repo, I will be include all the code I `wrote`/`will write` while learning Rust from the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

- This repo holds multiple sections and each section has a prefix number to indicate the order of the section.

  > For example, `1_*folder-name*` would be the first section and `2_*folder-name*` would be the second section and so on.

- Inside each section, there will be a `README.md` files and many cargo projects.
- The `README.md` file inside each section (For e.g. `1_common_programming_concepts/README.md`) will contain the order of the projects to follow. Each project follows the standard cargo project structure.
- The source code themself will contain comments to explain the code. The notes are written as comments in the source code itself.
